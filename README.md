## Instructions For Set-Up

## How The Game Works

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

* Flip one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* Then turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

Note: The above game description and rules were taken from the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Memory Game project description.

## Special Features

* Timer --> When the player begins the game, a count-up timer is started. Once the player wins, the timer stops and the time to win is recorded.
* Move count & star rating --> Each move the player makes is recorded and displayed. The fewer moves it takes to win the game, the more stars the player will have.
