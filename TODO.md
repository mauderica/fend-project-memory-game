# Memory Game Project

## To-Do List

* Development strategy: plan project and break it down into smaller pieces. -- ongoing
* Refactoring
* Winning condition & what happens when it is achieved. -- in progress
    * Congratulations Popup: -- in progress
        * When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. (delay & ensure last 2 cards are flipped)
        * It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was. (separate the minutes from seconds)
* Review project rubric for additional items.
* Review previous project list & project review for additional items.
* Custom styling (save for last).
    * Achieve a nice, slower card-flipping effect.
    * Hover effect (CSS) over cards.
    * Special effect for matched cards.
    * Special effect for un-matched cards.
    * Change style for removed star & add an effect for the removal.
    * Monospace font for the timer (so that it doesn't jump around).
